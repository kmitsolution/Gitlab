Certainly! Let's look at **troubleshooting** and **handling job timeouts** in **GitLab CI/CD**, with simple examples and best practices.

## üß∞ 1. **Troubleshooting GitLab CI/CD Pipelines**

When a job fails, here are common things to check:

| üîß Issue | üîç Troubleshooting Steps |
|---------|--------------------------|
| **Job fails to start** | Check runner status (Settings ‚Üí CI/CD ‚Üí Runners) |
| **Permission denied** | Ensure SSH key or AWS credentials are set in CI/CD variables |
| **Command not found** | Check image used and install required tools |
| **Network errors** | Check if the runner has internet/VPC access |
| **Docker build fails** | Check Dockerfile syntax and image versions |

---

### üß™ Example: Missing `mvn` Command

```yaml
build:
  script:
    - mvn clean install
```

üí• Error:
```
mvn: command not found
```

‚úÖ Fix: Use an image that has Maven preinstalled.

```yaml
image: maven:3.8.6-openjdk-17
```

## ‚è≥ 2. **Handling Job Timeout in GitLab CI/CD**

By default, GitLab jobs have a timeout (e.g., 1 hour). You can override it:

### üìù Example 1: Set Job Timeout in `.gitlab-ci.yml`

```yaml
build:
  script:
    - ./long-running-script.sh
  timeout: 30 minutes
```

### üìù Example 2: Global Timeout (Project-wide)

In GitLab UI:

> **Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí CI/CD ‚Üí General Pipelines ‚Üí Timeout**

Set the timeout for *all* jobs (e.g., 1 hour).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Timeout Troubleshooting

| Scenario | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Job times out waiting for input | Add `when: manual` and run manually |
| Long Docker builds | Use `cache` and `artifacts` to speed up |
| Command hangs (e.g., no output) | Use `echo` or `--verbose` options for visibility |
| Git clone times out | Use a shallow clone: `GIT_DEPTH: 1` |

---

### ‚úÖ Example: Keep Output to Avoid Timeout (for silent builds)

```yaml
script:
  - ./build.sh | tee build.log
```

Or force periodic output:

```bash
while true; do echo "still running..."; sleep 60; done &
./your_script.sh
```
