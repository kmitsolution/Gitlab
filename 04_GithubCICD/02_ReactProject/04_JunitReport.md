# 📄  Adding JUnit Test Report in GitLab CI/CD for React Project (`learn-gitlab-app`)

---

## 1️⃣ Project Overview

We are working with a **React.js** application cloned from:

> [https://gitlab.com/myfirstgroup7711117/learn-gitlab-app.git](https://gitlab.com/myfirstgroup7711117/learn-gitlab-app.git)

The goal is:
- Build the React project
- Test if the build artifacts exist
- Run unit tests
- **Generate a JUnit test report** for GitLab to automatically show test results in the UI

---

## 2️⃣ Full `.gitlab-ci.yml` for JUnit Test Report

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build_website:
  image: node:22-alpine
  stage: build
  script:
    - node --version
    - npm --version
    - npm ci
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths: 
      - build/

test_artifact:
  image: alpine
  stage: test
  script:
    - test -f build/index.html

unit_tests:
  image: node:22-alpine
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm test
  artifacts:
    when: always
    reports:
      junit: reports/junit.xml
```

## 3️⃣ 🛠️ Explanation of Each Section

| Job           | Stage | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| `build_website` | build | Build the React app using Node.js |
| `test_artifact` | test | Verify if the `build/index.html` exists |
| `unit_tests`    | test | Run unit tests and generate a JUnit report |

---

## 4️⃣ 📦 New Concepts Introduced

### ✅ `artifacts:`  
Artifacts are files or folders saved after a job finishes.  
We are now using them not just to save build output but also **test reports**.

```yaml
artifacts:
  when: always
  reports:
    junit: reports/junit.xml
```

### ✅ `when: always`
- **Meaning**: Even if the test job fails (example: some unit test fails), GitLab will still upload and show the `junit.xml` report.
- This ensures test results are always visible!

### ✅ `reports: junit`
- GitLab **natively understands** JUnit XML format.
- Once you upload the `reports/junit.xml`, GitLab will:
  - Parse it
  - Show the **tests summary** inside the Merge Request or Pipeline UI.
  - Highlight failed tests nicely.

---

## 5️⃣ ⚙️ How `npm test` Should Generate JUnit Report?

> You must configure your test framework to output a JUnit-style XML report to `reports/junit.xml`.

✅ If you're using **Jest** (most React projects do), add this to your `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "reporters": [
    "default",
    ["jest-junit", { "outputDirectory": "reports", "outputName": "junit.xml" }]
  ]
}
```

And install `jest-junit`:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest-junit
```

---

## 6️⃣ 🖼️ Pipeline Visual Flow

```plaintext
build_website (build stage)
        ↓
[test_artifact]  [unit_tests] (test stage, running parallel)
        ↓
[JUnit report available in GitLab UI 🎯]
```

---

# 🖥️ How It Will Look in GitLab UI

- Under your **Pipeline → Jobs** you will see **Test Summary** section
- GitLab will show:
  - Number of Tests Passed ✅
  - Number of Tests Failed ❌
  - Direct links to failed tests if any

(It's super helpful for debugging quickly 🔍)

# ⚡ Why Generate JUnit Report?

| Benefit                  | Why it Matters |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Test Visualization        | See tests result inside GitLab |
| Faster Debugging          | Quickly spot which tests failed |
| Automation Friendly       | Integrate test reports into approval processes |
| Professional Pipelines    | Industry best practice in DevOps |

---

# 📋 Quick Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1️⃣  | Clone the project |
| 2️⃣  | Build the React app |
| 3️⃣  | Test if `index.html` exists |
| 4️⃣  | Run unit tests and generate JUnit XML |
| 5️⃣  | GitLab shows test results beautifully! |

---

# 🎯 Final Pro Tip:

- Make sure the `reports/junit.xml` path **exactly matches** between your jest/junit configuration and `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
- Use `when: always` carefully, especially when tests might fail — it still uploads the report even if a job fails.
