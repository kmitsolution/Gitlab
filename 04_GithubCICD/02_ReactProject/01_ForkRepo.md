I’ll break it down clearly step-by-step as if you're preparing it for your own team or project report 🚀.

# 📄 Project Setup Documentation for GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

---

## 📌 Project Overview

We are working with a **React.js** application available at:

> [https://gitlab.com/myfirstgroup7711117/learn-gitlab-app.git](https://gitlab.com/myfirstgroup7711117/learn-gitlab-app.git)

This project will be used to create and test our **GitLab CI/CD pipeline**.

---

## 🛠️ Pre-requisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed on your local system:

| Tool       | Purpose                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Node.js    | Required to run and build React apps |
| npm (Node Package Manager) | Comes with Node.js, used to install dependencies |
| serve (Global npm package) | To serve the built React app locally |

> 📥 If Node.js is not installed, download it from: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## 🚀 Steps to Setup and Run Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/myfirstgroup7711117/learn-gitlab-app.git
```

This will create a folder named `learn-gitlab-app` containing the project code.

---

### 2. Open in VSCode

```bash
cd learn-gitlab-app
code .
```
`code .` opens the project in Visual Studio Code editor.

---

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

🔹 **What this command does:**
- Reads the `package.json` file.
- Installs all required **npm packages** (like React, React-DOM, etc.).
- Creates a folder called `node_modules/` containing all the dependencies.

---

### 4. Build the React Application

```bash
npm run build
```

🔹 **What this command does:**
- Compiles the React app into **static files** (`HTML`, `CSS`, `JS`) inside a folder called `build/`.
- Optimizes the app for **production deployment** (minifies JavaScript, etc.).

The `build/` folder is the final output that we can deploy anywhere!

---

### 5. Serve the Application Locally

First, install `serve` globally if not already installed:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

🔹 **What this command does:**
- Installs the `serve` tool globally in your system so you can use it from anywhere.

Now, to serve your build locally:

```bash
serve -s build/
```

🔹 **What this command does:**
- `-s` means "serve it statically."
- It starts a local server and serves files from the `build/` directory.
- You can now view the application at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port it shows).

---

## 🛠️ Why This Setup is Important for GitLab CI/CD?

- In **GitLab CI/CD**, we want to **automate** these steps.
- The GitLab Runner will:
  1. Clone the project.
  2. Install `npm` dependencies (`npm install`).
  3. Build the project (`npm run build`).
  4. Save or deploy the `build/` folder as **artifacts**.
  
Thus, setting this up manually first helps us **understand the automation** we are about to build.

# 📦 Summary of Important npm Commands

| Command               | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| `npm install`          | Install project dependencies listed in `package.json`. |
| `npm run build`        | Create optimized production build inside the `build/` directory. |
| `npm install -g serve` | Install static file server globally. |
| `serve -s build/`      | Serve the `build/` folder as a static site locally. |

---

# 📋 Final Note for GitLab CI/CD

When we create the `.gitlab-ci.yml`, we must:
- Ensure the CI Runner environment **has Node.js installed**.
- Replicate these exact npm steps in our pipeline.
- Use **artifacts** to store and transfer the `build/` output between pipeline jobs.

# 🎨 Quick Visual (Project Flow)

```plaintext
Clone Repo → npm install → npm run build → serve build/ → Run locally
```

🔜 Next step: automate all this inside GitLab pipeline!
