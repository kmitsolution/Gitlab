# ðŸ“„ Needs in GitLab CI/CD Pipeline

---

## ðŸš€ What is `needs` in GitLab CI/CD?

- `needs` is used to **define job dependencies**.
- It **controls the execution order** â€” even if the jobs are in the same stage.
- It **allows jobs to run earlier** if their dependencies are ready.
- It helps in **saving pipeline execution time** by running jobs in parallel when possible.

---

## ðŸ›  Simple Example Without `needs`

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
```

### ðŸ“‹ Behavior:
- `build_job` runs first (stage = build).
- `test_job` runs only after **build stage is completely done**.

Even if `test_job` doesn't depend on build artifacts, it **waits** â€” this is **sequential**.

---

## ðŸ›  Same Example WITH `needs`

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."

test_job:
  stage: test
  needs:
    - build_job
  script:
    - echo "Running tests..."
```

### ðŸ“‹ Behavior:
- `test_job` will start **immediately after** `build_job` finishes.
- Other test jobs can **start earlier** without waiting for all build jobs to finish.
- **Better parallelism** and **faster pipelines**.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Even Better Example: 2 Parallel Test Jobs

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project..."

unit_test:
  stage: test
  needs:
    - build_job
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests..."

integration_test:
  stage: test
  needs:
    - build_job
  script:
    - echo "Running integration tests..."
```

### ðŸ“‹ Behavior:

| Step | Details |
|-----|---------|
| 1 | `build_job` runs first. |
| 2 | As soon as `build_job` finishes, **both** `unit_test` and `integration_test` start **together** (in parallel). |
| âœ… | This saves time compared to running them one after another. |

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Pictorial View (Very Simple)

```plaintext
build_job
   â†“
+------------+------------+
| unit_test  | integration_test |
```

âœ… Both tests run **in parallel** after `build_job`!

# ðŸ§  Quick Summary

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `needs` | Defines job dependencies manually |
| Benefit | Faster pipelines, better parallelism |
| Default Without `needs` | Jobs wait for previous stage to complete |
| Default With `needs` | Jobs can run immediately after dependency |

---

# âš¡ Final Tips

- Always use `needs` if you want to speed up your pipelines.
- Useful when jobs are **independent** but belong to **different stages**.
- In big projects, `needs` **saves a lot of time**.
