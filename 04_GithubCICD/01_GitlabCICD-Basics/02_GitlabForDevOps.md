# Role of GitLab in DevOps

---

### 🚀 **What is GitLab?**
GitLab is an **all-in-one DevOps platform**.  
It combines **source control**, **CI/CD**, **security**, and **monitoring** — all in one place.

> Think of GitLab as a “one-stop shop” for everything in the software development and delivery lifecycle.

### 🧩 **Role of GitLab in DevOps**

GitLab supports the **entire DevOps lifecycle**:
1. **Plan** – Issue boards, milestones, roadmaps
2. **Create** – Git repositories, merge requests, code reviews
3. **Verify** – Automated testing through CI pipelines
4. **Package** – Container/image registry built-in
5. **Release** – CD pipelines, approvals, environment configs
6. **Configure** – Infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform modules)
7. **Monitor** – Built-in monitoring and metrics

So GitLab helps both **Dev** and **Ops** teams to:
- Collaborate better
- Automate workflows
- Deliver faster and more securely
