## Namespace or Group in Gitlab

A **namespace** in GitLab is a **container** for your projects. It can be:
- A **user namespace** (your personal GitLab space),
- A **group namespace** (for teams/organizations),
- A **subgroup** (nested under a group for further organization).

Every project **must** belong to a namespace.

---

## 🔍 How to **See Existing Namespaces**

1. Log in to GitLab.
2. Click your **profile avatar > Your groups**.
3. You’ll see:
   - Your personal namespace (your GitLab username).
   - Any groups or subgroups you’re a member of (these are other namespaces).

---

## 🆕 How to **Create a New Namespace (Group)**

Namespaces are created when you create a **group or subgroup**.

### ✅ To Create a Group (Top-Level Namespace):
1. Click the **“Project” menu** on the left panel.
2. Select **“Create a group”**.
3. You’ll be asked to either:
   - **Create a group** from scratch.
   - **Import a group** from another GitLab instance.

---

### 🗂️ **Import a Group** (from another GitLab instance):
To import:
- You need the **GitLab source instance base URL**
- A **Personal Access Token**
- The **Group name** and **Group URL**
- Optionally, you can **upload a file** (exported group archive)

> 📥 To export: Go to the **source group’s settings** → Generate and download the export file.

---

### ✳️ **To Create a Group**:
You’ll be asked to fill in:
- **Group Name** (e.g., `Kmit`)
- **Group URL** (auto-generated but editable)
- **Visibility Level** (Private, Internal, Public)
- **Who will be using this group?** (Personal, Team, Business)
- Then click **"Create group"**

After this, your **new namespace** is created and ready to hold projects.

---

### 🔁 To Create a **Subgroup** (Nested Namespace):
1. Go to an existing group (e.g., `Kmit`)
2. Click **“New subgroup”**
3. Fill in the subgroup name, URL, visibility
4. Click **"Create subgroup"**

> Result: A new namespace like `gitlab.com/kmit/backend-team`

---

## 🗑️ How to **Delete a Namespace (Group)**

> ⚠️ Only the **Owner** can delete a group.

1. Go to the group/subgroup.
2. Click **Settings > General**.
3. Scroll to the **"Advanced"** section.
4. Click **"Remove group"**, confirm the action.

> ⚠️ This deletes the group and **all projects inside** it permanently.

## 📦 Which Namespace Is Used When Creating a Project?

When you create a project, GitLab will ask:
- **Where do you want to create this project?**
- You can select:
  - Your **personal namespace**
  - Any **group or subgroup** you belong to

GitLab does **not automatically create a namespace** when creating a project — you choose one.

---

## 🛠️ How to **Create a Project in a Specific Namespace**

1. Click **“New Project”**
2. Enter your **project name**
3. In the **Namespace** dropdown:
   - Select your target group/subgroup (e.g., `Kmit/Backend-Team`)
4. Choose visibility, initialize settings, etc.
5. Click **"Create project"**

✅ The project will be created under the chosen namespace with a URL like:
`gitlab.com/kmit/backend-team/payment-gateway`
