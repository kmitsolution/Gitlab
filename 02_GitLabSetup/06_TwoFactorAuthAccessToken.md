### **GitLab Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and Access Tokens**

GitLab's **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** adds an extra layer of security to your account, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify your repositories. When enabled, you'll be required to provide a second form of verification in addition to your passwordâ€”typically, a one-time code sent to your phone via an authenticator app or SMS.

This document explains how to configure and use **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, and how to generate and use **Access Tokens** to **clone** and **push** changes to a GitLab repository after enabling 2FA.

---

### **Steps to Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in GitLab:**

1. **Log in to GitLab**:  
   Go to your [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in) and log in using your credentials.

2. **Navigate to your Profile**:
   - In the top-right corner of your GitLab dashboard, click on your **profile picture** or avatar.
   - From the dropdown menu, click on **"Edit profile"**.

3. **Go to Two-Factor Authentication Settings**:
   - On the left sidebar, under **Account**, select **"Two-factor Authentication"**.

4. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**:
   - GitLab will prompt you to **configure 2FA**.
   - Download and install an **Authenticator App** (such as Google Authenticator or Authy) on your mobile device.
   - Scan the QR code displayed in GitLab with your authenticator app.
   - Enter the code generated by the app to confirm and activate **2FA**.

5. **Backup Codes**:
   - After enabling 2FA, GitLab will generate **backup codes** that you can use in case you lose access to your authenticator app.
   - **Save these codes** in a secure place.

### **Using Access Tokens After Enabling 2FA**

Once you've enabled 2FA, you cannot use your regular GitLab password for **Git operations** (like `git clone` or `git push`). Instead, you need to generate and use an **Access Token** to authenticate these operations.

#### **Steps to Create an Access Token**:

1. **Go to Access Tokens Page**:
   - In the **Profile Settings** page (where you enabled 2FA), go to **Access Tokens** on the left sidebar.
   
2. **Create a Personal Access Token**:
   - Enter a **name** for your token (e.g., "Git Operations Token").
   - Set the **expiration date** if desired (optional).
   - Select the required **scopes** for the token. At a minimum, you will need:
     - `api`: Provides full access to the GitLab API.
     - `read_repository`: Grants access to read repositories.
     - `write_repository`: Allows pushing changes to repositories.
   
   Example of required scopes for cloning and pushing:
   - `read_repository`
   - `write_repository`
   
   - Click **"Create personal access token"**.

3. **Save Your Token**:
   - GitLab will display your **Personal Access Token** once, so **copy it** and store it securely (e.g., in a password manager).
   - You will not be able to see the token again.

### **Using Personal Access Token for Git Operations (Clone and Push)**

After generating your **Personal Access Token**, you can use it to authenticate Git operations such as **cloning** and **pushing** to your GitLab repository.

#### **1. Cloning a GitLab Repository with Access Token:**

Normally, when you clone a GitLab repository, you would use your username and password for authentication. However, after enabling 2FA, you need to use your **Personal Access Token** instead of your GitLab password.

1. **Clone the repository** using HTTPS:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. **Authentication**:
   - When prompted for a password, instead of your GitLab password, use the **Personal Access Token** you generated earlier.
   - Git will authenticate you using the token, and the cloning process will proceed.

#### **2. Pushing Changes to a GitLab Repository with Access Token:**

When pushing changes to a GitLab repository after enabling 2FA, you'll also need to authenticate using the **Personal Access Token**.

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```

2. **Push the changes**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Authentication**:
   - When prompted for a password, enter the **Personal Access Token** (not your GitLab password).
   - Git will authenticate you using the token, and the push will be successful.

### **Summary of Key Points**:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** adds an extra layer of security to your GitLab account, requiring a second form of verification (like an authenticator app).
- **Access Tokens** are required for Git operations (like `git clone` and `git push`) after enabling 2FA, as GitLab no longer allows password authentication for these operations.
- To **generate an Access Token**:
  1. Navigate to **Profile Settings** > **Access Tokens**.
  2. Create a token with appropriate scopes (e.g., `read_repository`, `write_repository`).
  3. Use the generated token as your password for Git operations.

### **Example Git Commands**:

- **Clone** with Access Token:
  ```bash
  git clone https://gitlab.com/username/repository-name.git
  ```
  When prompted for a password, enter the **Personal Access Token**.

- **Push** with Access Token:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  git push origin main
  ```
  When prompted for a password, enter the **Personal Access Token**.

By following these steps, you'll be able to securely clone and push changes to your GitLab repositories, even with **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** enabled.
