#### **Step 8: Install Git and Connect to Your GitLab Account (Optional)**
1. If you plan to push code from your local machine to GitLab, you’ll need to install Git.
   - **For Windows**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
   - **For macOS**: Git is usually pre-installed, but you can install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if needed.
   - **For Linux**: Use the package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git` for Ubuntu).
2. After installing Git, you can link it to your GitLab account using SSH keys for secure communication.
   - In GitLab, go to **Settings > SSH Keys** and generate a new SSH key pair (using `ssh-keygen` command) on your machine.
   - Copy the public key and add it to your GitLab SSH keys.
   - This allows you to push and pull from your repositories securely.

#### **Step 9: Explore GitLab Features**
1. **Create an Issue:** Start using GitLab’s issue tracking system to create tasks, bugs, or features for your project.
2. **Create a Merge Request (MR):** If you’re working with a team, try creating a merge request for code reviews.
3. **Explore CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up your first pipeline for continuous integration or deployment by creating a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your project.
